# LiveCode universal button widget

This LCB widget can be used as a button, as a toggle-button  
and as a segmented control if multiple buttons are combined  
in a group.  
The widget responds to mouseDown, mouseUp, mouseCancel,  
mouseEnter and mouseLeave messages. It has a default state  
and a "highlighted" state. It can display an SVG icon or  
(multiline) text only or both. Icon and text can be different  
in the respective states. Every button corner can be rounded  
separately.  
There are lots of properties which can be adjusted, please see  
the documentation you can load using the Extension Manager.  


### Segmented control demo:

There is a demo stack (universalControlStack.livecode)  
included which demonstrates how to mimic a segmented  
control by using grouped button widgets.  

#### Instructions:

Note: Before opening the demo stack you should install  
the LCB universal button extension  
(community.livecode.rabit.universalbutton.1.0.0.lce)  
which is located in the "universalButtonSource" folder  
of the "universal-button-widget" package.  
Then open the stack and follow the instructions contained  
in the stack.
