# LiveCode universal button widget

This LCB widget can be used as a button, as a toggle-button
and as a segmented control if multiple buttons are combined
in a group.
The widget responds to mouseDown, mouseUp, mouseCancel,
mouseEnter and mouseLeave messages. It has a default state
and a "highlighted" state. It can display an SVG icon or
(multiline) text only or both. Icon and text can be different
in the respective states. Every button corner can be rounded
separately.
The widget icon can be placed independently of the label. The
size of the icon can be customized.
There are lots of properties which can be adjusted, please see
the documentation you can load using the Extension Manager,
or search the dictionary for "Universal Button".


### Segmented control demo:

There is a demo stack (universalControlStack.livecode)
included which demonstrates how to mimic a segmented
control by using grouped button widgets.

#### Instructions:

Note: Before opening the demo stack you should install
the LCB universal button extension
(community.livecode.rabit.universalbutton.1.3.1.lce)
which is located in the "universalButtonSource" folder
of the "universal-button-widget" package.
Then open the stack and follow the instructions contained
in the stack.
